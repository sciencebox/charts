#
# Number of frontier-squid pods to run
#
#   Squid is seamlessly load-balanced via its network service. Running more replicas
#     will provide more capacity and the ability to serve more clients.
#   Consider enabling PodAntiAffinity to increase availability.
#
replicas: 1

#
# Squid pod resource requests and limits (CPU, RAM, etc.)
#
resources: {}

#
# priorityClassName, recommended for high-occupancy clusters to prioritize squid over other pods.
#
priorityClassName: ""

#
# Assign frontier-squid pod(s) to a node with a specific label
#   and distribute them on different nodes to avoid single points of failure.
#
podAssignment:
  # If true, requires a node labeled as per customLabels.
  enableNodeSelector: false
  # If true, run the pods on separate nodes if possible.
  #   Relevant only when running multiple replicas.
  #   Highly recommended for production scenarios.
  enablePodAntiAffinity: false

#
# Custom labels to identify frontier-squid pod(s).
#
# They are used by node selection, if enabled (see above).
# Label nodes accordingly to avoid scheduling problems.
#
customLabels:
  service: cvmfs
  component: frontier-squid

#
# Enable or disable health probes.

#
# Liveness Probe:
#   Checks every 10 seconds whether it is possible to open a TCP socket againsts port 3128.
#   The frontier-squid container will be restarted after 3 failures.
#
# Readiness Probe:
#   Checks every 30 seconds whether the readinessUrl is reachable using the squid in the pod as proxy.
#   If unreachable, the failing frontier-squid pod will be removed from the service load-balanced alias.
#
#   Readiness Urls:
#     The URLs used by the readiness probe to check the squid in the pod works as expected.
#     Two URLs are used as backups for each other, to avoid marking the pods unready if one external server is unavailable.
#
# Default: All probes enabled.
